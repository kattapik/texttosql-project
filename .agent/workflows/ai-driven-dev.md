2. Read the project flow architecture context.
// turbo
   `view_file c:\Users\kritk\OneDrive\Desktop\working\texttosql\context\project-instruction\flow.md`

3. Read important project constraints and goals.
// turbo
   `view_file c:\Users\kritk\OneDrive\Desktop\working\texttosql\context\project-instruction\important.md`

4. Read the development log to understand recent changes and decisions.
// turbo
   `view_file c:\Users\kritk\OneDrive\Desktop\working\texttosql\context\log\ai_development_log.md`

5. **CRITICAL**: At the end of your task, you MUST update `c:\Users\kritk\OneDrive\Desktop\working\texttosql\context\log\(create a file)` with a summary of:
   - What changes were made.
   - Why they were made (reasoning).
   - Any architectural decisions or deviations from the plan.
